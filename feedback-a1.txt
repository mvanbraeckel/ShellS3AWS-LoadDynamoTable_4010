Feed back:

"graded using commit `5a14d1dee`. All of your programs are very well documented. Mkbucket ma-test-45 fails. Ls in a subdir prints the whole path from the root of the bucket, this is not the desired behavior. The dynamodb programs handled all the errors I gave it. "

took off 0.5 marks for mkbucket not working with a - character
gave you one more mark for the ls -l functionality in a bucket.
